npm install react-router-dom@6

wrap App with BrowsrRouter in index.js or BrowserRouter as Router

import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom"; in App.js

to give style dynamically according isActive use NavLinks

while using authentication wrap everything inside AuthProvider in App.js

useNavigate for navigation

<Navigate to="/profile" /> is same is <Profile/>

use Routes instead of Switch
